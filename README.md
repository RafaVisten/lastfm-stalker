# Last.fm Stalker
Extremely simple app made using [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) and the [pylast](https://github.com/pylast/pylast) python library for checking what people are currently listening to.
Does the same thing [this website](https://jakeledoux.com/live/) does except it takes a manual list of users instead of your friendlist, so no login is needed.
